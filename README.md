## Bio
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Nevada, Reno, working on NSF-funded climate change adaptation research in underserved rural communities. My background spans environmental and agricultural economics, with a Ph.D. from Oklahoma State University. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve complex problems in agriculture, resource management, and climate resilience.

## Current Projects

### Droughts, Perception, and Adaptation Project
- **Description**: This project investigates how the divergence between farmers' perceptions of drought and actual climate data influences adaptation decisions. We use a framework based on the difference between perceived and instrumented drought measures (PΔI).

### The Energy-Water Nexus Under Stress: Drought Impacts on Electricity Generation
- **Description**: This project explores the impact of drought conditions, measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), on electricity generation by fuel source across U.S. watersheds. Electricity generation in the U.S. relies heavily on water-intensive thermal and hydroelectric plants, making it vulnerable to increasing drought severity underclimate change. Building on Eyer and Wichman (2018), we examine how droughts reshape the electricity generation mix.

## PhD Dissertation: *Evaluation of Nitrogen Management Strategies and Comparison of Cool-Season Perennial Forage Systems*

### Chapter One: Value of In-season Information on Nitrogen Application Decisions
- **Description**: An economic evaluation of the N-rich strip method for optimizing nitrogen use in winter wheat production, comparing conventional and in-season decision strategies.

### Chapter Two: Managing Nitrogen Carryover for Winter Wheat Production Systems
- **Description**: This chapter models nitrogen residual dynamics and evaluates optimal management strategies using a crop growth simulation and economic optimization approach.

### Chapter Three: Economic Comparison of Stocker Cattle Performance on Winter Wheat vs. Summer-Dormant Tall Fescue with Nitrogen or Interseeded Alfalfa in the Southern Great Plains
- **Description**: A comparative economic analysis of dual-purpose forage systems, assessing gain, nitrogen use, and profitability in stocker cattle operations.
